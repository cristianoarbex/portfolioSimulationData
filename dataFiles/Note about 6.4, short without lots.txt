Upon further examination of the output log files, one can see that the sum of
the Hij variables is sometimes smaller than the real borrowing costs as
calcualted "by hand".

While this is theoretically impossible, CPLEX has a tolerance of 1e-5 to
decide whether a variable if integer or not, and these inaccuracies are a
result of this tolerance. 

It is possible to reduce the tolerance to 1e-9, for instance. While this
sometimes solves the issue, in other times CPLEX reports status 115:

CPXMIP_OPTIMAL_INFEAS 115
Problem is optimal with unscaled infeasibilities

Even with a more strict tolerance, this problem sometimes still happens. This
is much more common in the model with borrowing costs and no lots then in the
model with both borrowing costs and lots.

Whenever the difference is negative, in the paper we artificially set them to
zero in order to proceed with the calculations (this very rarely also happened
is a much smaller scale in some experiments of Section 6.5).
